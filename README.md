~~Download either solver 1 or 2, mostly working on 1 since that'll be more useful since OCR crap and stuff isn't that good.~~
Too lazy to work on 1 so just do 2 forget 1 i'll do that later if 1 progress is slow
or don't idrc if somebody is willing to try and link it to GPT's API or something?


idfk what I'm doing and this probably won't even come to fruition
