~~Download either solver 1 or 2, mostly working on 1 since that'll be more useful since OCR crap and stuff isn't that good.~~
Forget all that

Nothing is working yet

Progress
Working on Solver 1 for Cengage WebAssign

Summary
2 for Aleks, one for Cengage. Solver 1 for both consists of scanning the html to figure out the equations and questions, better for Cengage with a more accesible setup, especially regarding symbols. Solver 2 takes a screenshot of the webpage, better for Aleks since it has a one question per page system, unlike Cengage which has a page with every single question on it making it too small for GPT's OCR to accurately read.

Both with send their respective data to GPT using OpenAI's API, whether directly to it, or through Vision first (for solver 2).


Note
Too lazy to work on 1 so just do 2 forget 2 i'll do that later if 1 progress is slow
or don't idrc if somebody is willing to try and link it to GPT's API or something?

idfk what I'm doing and this probably won't even come to fruition
