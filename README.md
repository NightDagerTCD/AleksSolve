Download either sovler 1 or 2, mostly working on 1 since that'll be more useful since OCR crap and stuff isn't that good.

Solver 1

Basically, we be having the extension identify the question (after hours of me scanning the html), then we gonna run it into some big companies AI API to solve it
End goal is to have it give the answer right away (or at least something useable???)

So far, got it to identify sub/superscript (SScript) by checking the change in font, since regular is usually like 15px while the SScripts are 12px

Next trying to get fractions by checking the positioning of the numbers.


Solver 2

It take screenshot. Maybe we can put into AI API???
